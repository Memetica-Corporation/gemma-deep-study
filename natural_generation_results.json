Here's a comprehensive explanation, broken down into sections for clarity:\n\n**1. The Big Picture: A Continuous Loop**\n\n*   **Water is Key:** The water cycle describes how *all* of Earth's water (oceans, rivers, ice caps, glaciers, water vapor in the atmosphere, groundwater \u2013 everything!) is in constant,ochemicals.\n*   **Continuous Loop:**  It's not a linear process; it's a cycle!  Water molecules are constantly moving around the Earth, changing states as they move.  There's no real \"start\" or \"end\" to the cycle \u2013 it's a continuous cycle-of-water-and-chemicals.\n\n**2. The Key Processes: How Water Moves & Changes**\n\nLet's look at the main things that happen in the water cycle:\n\n*   **Evaporation:**  This is the most well-bodies-of-water-and-chemicals.  Heat from the suns the water, turning it into water vapor (gas).  This happens all over the Earth'.
